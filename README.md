# Neo4j

Neo4j is a graph database that stores data as a graph in nodes and relationships. It is particularly useful when the connections between data are as important as the data itself.

The key elements of a Neo4j graph database are:
- Nodes: These are the circles or vertices that represent objects or entities (e.g., people, companies, locations).
- Labels: Used to categorize nodes, describing what they are (e.g., "Person," "Company," "Location"). A node can have multiple labels.
- Relationships: These are the lines or edges that describe how nodes are connected. All relationships have a type (e.g., "WORKS_AT") and a direction.
- Properties: Named key-value pairs used to store data on both nodes and relationships (e.g., "first name," "last name"). They can have various data types.

# Key points

- Importance of Relationships in Graphs: In a graph database, relationships are considered as important as the nodes they connect. This contrasts with traditional methods where relationships might be an afterthought.

- Challenges with Traditional Data Storage:

    - Poor Performance: Traversing foreign keys and many-to-many relationships can lead to slow performance.

    - Difficulty in Hierarchical Data: Finding the right answers in hierarchical data or tree structures can be challenging.

    - Navigating Changing Data: It can be difficult to navigate paths through data sets that are constantly changing.

    - Expressing Data Needs: Simply expressing what data you are looking for can be hard.
These issues often arise because data is stored in tables when the primary need is to understand relationships, not just rows.

- Limitations of Tabular Data:

    - While tabular data is a tried and tested method, it faces challenges as the amount of data grows or the use case becomes more complex, especially when dealing with relationships.

    - Querying across tables using joins, which rely on indexes, leads to slower response times as the data and index size increase. This is known as the Big O or ON notation problem.

- Advantages of Graph Databases:

    - Efficient Relationship Handling: Graph databases store pointers to relationships with each node, allowing the database to follow these pointers in memory when reading data, rather than relying on an underlying index.

    - Constant Query Time: This approach means that query time remains constant relative to the number of relationships, regardless of the overall data size.

    - Faster Results: Graph databases yield much faster results when querying relationships.

- Use Cases for Graph Databases: Graph databases are particularly useful when you need to:

    - Understand the relationships between entities.

    - Self-reference data of the same type, such as hierarchies.

    - Find relationships of varying or unknown depth.

    - Calculate a route between two points in a network.

    - More generally, graph databases are a great fit for scenarios where handling relationships is crucial.

# Cypher

Cypher is Neo4jâ€™s implementation of GQL. Cypher is a declarative language, meaning the database is responsible for finding the most optimal way of executing that query.

## Syntax
- MATCH Clause:

    - Purpose: The MATCH clause is used to specify the patterns that Cypher will search for in the graph database. It's the primary way to find nodes and relationships that fit a certain structure.

    - Syntax: You define patterns using nodes (in parentheses ()) and relationships (with dashes and arrows --, -->, <--). You can include labels (e.g., (p:Person)) and properties (e.g., (m:Movie {title: 'Wall Street'})) within the node patterns. Relationship types are specified in square brackets (e.g., -[r:ACTED_IN]-), this's called Pattern.

    - Functionality: MATCH can find all nodes, nodes with specific labels, related nodes, and matches based on relationship direction or type. It can also use variables for nodes and relationships to refer to them later in the query.

- WHERE Clause:

    - Purpose: The WHERE clause is a subclause used with MATCH (and OPTIONAL MATCH and WITH) to add conditions or predicates to filter the results. It's crucial for narrowing down the data retrieved by the MATCH clause.

    - Syntax: It follows a MATCH clause and uses standard boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR), comparison operators (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=), list operators, string operators (STARTS WITH, ENDS WITH, CONTAINS), and IS NULL/IS NOT NULL to define filtering criteria.

    - Functionality: You can filter on node labels, node properties, and relationship properties. WHERE predicates are considered part of the pattern description and can be evaluated before, during, or after pattern matching for efficiency.

- RETURN Clause:

    - Purpose: The RETURN clause specifies what data (nodes, relationships, and/or properties) should be included in the query result. It's similar to SELECT in SQL.

    - Syntax: You list the variables (nodes, relationships) or specific properties you want to return, separated by commas. You can also use RETURN * to return all elements found in the query.

    - Functionality: It allows you to return entire nodes or relationships, specific properties of nodes or relationships (e.g., p.name), and you can use the AS keyword to alias returned columns for better readability (e.g., p.nationality AS citizenship). Expressions can also be used as return items.

- MERGE Clause:

    - Purpose: The MERGE clause is a powerful Cypher command that acts as a combination of MATCH and CREATE. Its primary purpose is to ensure a pattern (nodes and relationships) exists in the graph. If the specified pattern already exists, MERGE matches it. If it doesn't exist, MERGE creates it. This makes it an idempotent operation, meaning you can run the same MERGE statement multiple times, and it will only result in the creation of the pattern once.

    - Syntax:

        - Node Merge: MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})

            - If a Person node named 'Alice' exists, it is matched.

            - If not, a new Person node with name: 'Alice' is created.

            - Crucially, all properties specified in the MERGE clause are used to identify uniqueness. If you only MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'}) and there's an 'Alice' node with an additional property like age: 30, it will still match that existing node.

        - Relationship Merge: MERGE (u:User {id: 'U1'})-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie {title: 'Inception'})

            - This attempts to find the User 'U1', the Movie 'Inception', and the RATED relationship between them.

            - If any part of this pattern is missing, MERGE will create the missing pieces to complete the pattern. For instance, if 'U1' and 'Inception' exist but the RATED relationship doesn't, only the relationship will be created. If 'U1' doesn't exist, it will be created, and so on.

        - ON CREATE and ON MATCH:
            - MERGE can be combined with ON CREATE SET and ON MATCH SET to specify actions depending on whether the pattern was created or matched.

            - Example:
                ```
                MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Bob'})
                ON CREATE SET p.created = timestamp() // Set creation timestamp if new
                ON MATCH SET p.lastAccessed = timestamp() // Update access time if matched
                RETURN p
                ```
