# 02. Intermediate Cypher Queries

## Overview
- Filter Queries using pattern matching and the `WHERE` clause
- Order results using the `ORDER` clause
- Paginate results using `SKIP` and `LIMIT`
- Eliminate duplicates using `DISTINCT`
- Produce Map Productions
- Perform Aggregations
- Work with Dates and Times
- Perform variable length traversals
- Process data using pipelines
- Use the `UNWIND` command to turn a list into multiple rows
- Optimise memory usage using Subqueries
- Use parameters within your Cypher queries
