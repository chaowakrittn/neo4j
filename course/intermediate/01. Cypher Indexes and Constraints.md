# 01. Cypher Indexes and Constraints

## Overview

Constraints and indexes are essential tools for maintaining data integrity and optimizing query performance in Neo4j. 

Constraints enforce data rules by implementing uniqueness for single properties, existence requirements for properties, or node keys for multiple properties, and should be created before loading data. 

Indexes, on the other hand, are data structures that accelerate data retrieval by providing fast access paths - they include RANGE, LOOKUP, TEXT, POINT, and full-text types, with composite indexes supporting multiple properties or relationships. 

While indexes improve query performance, they require additional storage and slow down write operations, so they should be strategically applied based on your most common query patterns rather than indexing everything.
