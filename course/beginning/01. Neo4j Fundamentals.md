# 01. Neo4j Fundamentals

## Overview
A **graph** is a data structure showing how objects are related. Objects (called **nodes**) are connected by **relationships** (edges).

**Course**: [Neo4j Fundamentals](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/?category=beginners)

### Neo4j Graph Database
- Neo4j stores data as **nodes** and **relationships** (not tables)
- Uses **labeled property graph** model
- Ideal when **connections between data matter as much as the data itself**

### Core Elements

#### 1. Nodes
- **Circles** in the graph
- Represent **entities** (people, companies, locations)
- Example: `○ Michael`, `○ Neo4j`

#### 2. Labels
- **Categorize** nodes (use nouns)
- Example: `Person`, `Company`, `Location`
- Nodes can have **multiple labels**: `Person:Employee`

#### 3. Relationships
- **Lines** connecting nodes (use verbs)
- Have **direction** and **type**
- Example: `Michael -[WORKS_AT]-> Neo4j`

#### 4. Properties
- **Key-value pairs** storing data
- Can be on nodes or relationships
- Example: `{name: "Michael", age: 35}`

### Example
```
(Person {name: "Michael"}) -[WORKS_AT {since: 2020}]-> (Company {name: "Neo4j"})
```

### Key Benefits
- **Natural modeling** of real-world relationships
- **Flexible schema** - easy to evolve
- **Fast traversal** of connections
- **Intuitive queries** that match how we think
