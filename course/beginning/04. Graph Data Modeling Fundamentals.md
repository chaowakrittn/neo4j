# 04. Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals

## Overview
Graph data modeling is essential for designing Neo4j databases that effectively answer key use cases while providing optimal performance. 

The process involves understanding your domain, defining specific use cases, and iteratively developing a graph model using nodes, labels, relationships, and properties. 

Unlike traditional databases with rigid schemas, Neo4j's flexible schema allows for easy refactoring as requirements evolve or performance needs change. 

The modeling process is iterative - you start with an initial model, test it against real use cases, refactor for performance or changing requirements, and continuously improve the design. 

This collaborative approach with stakeholders ensures the graph structure supports both current needs and future scalability.
